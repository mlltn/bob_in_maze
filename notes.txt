IDEAS
- option to show sliders in random order
- Base component could be composition and some kinda plugin the conductor

TODO

Actual experiment:
- Populate store from compositionJSON
- 

Data stored in database:
- Setup database connection
- save results to database

Customizable with JSON:
- parse composition from JSON
- move all hard coded values to JSON

Support for adding instruction slides:

Various:
- Access code check

Nice to have:
- Make Conductor general (eg. the locations to fetch images at mount and component composition)
- Reuse SliderMenu component better (currently new created for every task e.g. v-show instead of v-if)
