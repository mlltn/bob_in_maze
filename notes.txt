IDEAS
- option to show sliders in random order
- Base component could be composition and some kinda plugin the cond"uctor

TODO

Bugs:
- stimulus / test image mismatches caused by the temporary "step" variable
- reset score causes error - fixed by refactoring the menuslider visibility check

Actual experiment:
- Populate store from compositionJSON
- 

Data stored in database:
- Setup database connection
- save results to database

Customizable with JSON:
- move all hard coded values to JSON
- register components automatically
- implement template support

Support for adding instruction slides:


Various:
- Access code check
- Use flex box instead of inline-block for horizontal

Refactoring:
- Handle props cleaner (get rid of $attrs...)
- setup state mutation commit
- add styles cleaner

Nice to have:
- Make Conductor general (eg. the locations to fetch images at mount and component composition)
- Reuse SliderMenu component better (currently new created for every task e.g. v-show instead of v-if)
